#####Java Cryptographic Library/Helper for simplying the process of working with Java KeyStores.


This project requires the Java 1.8 unlimited strength encryption policy.

The file: `local_policy.jar` must be manually copied to location:

`${JRE_HOME}/lib/security/`

---
_You are advised to consult your export/import control counsel or attorney to determine if you can legally use this library_

---

At this time, the library jar files available in /target/*.jar must manually be added to your Java classpath.

Once ready for release I'll be adding this to maven central.
